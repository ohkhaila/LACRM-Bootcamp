    <h1>Treat Yo'Self!</h1>
    <p>Too often I find myself cutting out things that I enjoy because I have other commitments. So I have been trying
            to get away from that habit because I would fins that I hadn't done anything for myself in 2 or 3 weeks! There is a lot of
            value in spending time with yourself and doing things for yourself. Nothing is more important in your life than you. I mean that.
            Without you, you couldn't do ANY of the things that you do. SO take care of you! Take yourself out, walk in the park, take a nap,
            whatever you want to do. I challenge you to take 3 hours out of your week to do things that make you feel good.</p>
